### Studying Economic Sentiment: What is the relationship between economic sentiment and real measurements of the economy? 
According to the Federal Reserve, inflation expectations play a significant role in determining inflation.1 Consumer sentiment influences investment decisions, which in turn influences economic conditions and outcomes. For example, if consumers are optimistic about the future, they are more likely to invest and consume, which boosts the economy. In many ways, economic conditions can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. If consumers believe recession is coming, they will reduce their spending which in turn will eventually lead to recession-like conditions.
